TASK DEADLINES AND REMINDERS

 Introduction
 The project titled “Task Deadlines and Reminders” is designed to improve productivity and task
 management in any individual or team-based environment. It focuses on scheduling tasks,
 assigning deadlines, and providing automated reminders through real-time notifications and emails.
 The main goal is to help users stay organized, manage their workload efficiently, and ensure timely
 completion of responsibilities. In today’s fast-paced work and academic environments, missing
 important deadlines can cause significant disruptions. The Task Deadlines and Reminders system
 ensures that users receive timely alerts and reminders so that no task goes unnoticed or
 incomplete. The project integrates Flask (Python) as the backend framework, PostgreSQL for
 database management, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
 Problem Identification

 In most existing task management systems, users can create and manage tasks, but they often
 lack automated alert mechanisms for deadlines. Manual tracking of due dates becomes
 time-consuming and error-prone, especially when multiple projects or team members are involved.
 The absence of timely reminders results in missed deadlines, reduced productivity, and inefficient
 coordination. Common issues identified include: • Users forgetting to check pending tasks or
 nearing deadlines. • Lack of an automated reminder system to alert users in advance. • Managers
 unable to monitor overdue tasks effectively. • No synchronization between email alerts and system
 notifications.

 Objectives
 The primary objective of the Task Deadlines and Reminders project is to automate the monitoring
 and alerting process of tasks. It aims to reduce the need for manual follow-ups while increasing
 accountability among users. Key objectives include: 1. Provide automated alerts for approaching
 task deadlines. 2. Support both email and on-screen reminders for users. 3. Offer a user-friendly
 dashboard to view tasks by priority and deadline. 4. Ensure real-time synchronization of reminder
 notifications. 5. Allow administrators or team leads to track overdue and completed tasks

 System Requirements

 Functional Requirements: • Create, edit, and delete tasks with deadline information. • Trigger
 automated reminders before and after due dates. • Enable both dashboard pop-up and email alerts.
 • Display all tasks sorted by due date. • Allow admin to assign and monitor tasks. Non-Functional
 Requirements: • Responsive and intuitive user interface. • Reliable notification delivery with
 minimal delay. • High scalability for multiple concurrent users. • Secure authentication and
 role-based access. • Cross-platform compatibility and database security.
 System Design and Architecture
 The architecture of the Task Deadlines and Reminders system follows a client-server model. Users
 interact through a web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Flask backend
 handles business logic, database operations, and scheduling services. The system uses the
 following workflow: 1. A user creates a task with a defined title, description, and deadline. 2. Flask
 stores the task information in the PostgreSQL database. 3. APScheduler periodically checks for
 upcoming or missed deadlines. 4. When a deadline approaches, a reminder event is triggered. 5.
 Flask-Mail sends an email alert to the assigned user, while Socket.IO broadcasts a real-time
 notification to active users. 6. The reminder status and logs are stored in the database for auditing
 and history tracking. This architecture ensures efficient, reliable, and real-time communication
 between all components.
 Tools & Technologies
 The following technologies were used in the development of this project: • Frontend: HTML5,
 CSS3, JavaScript for building an interactive and responsive user interface. • Backend: Flask
 (Python) for managing routes, logic, and data flow. • Database: PostgreSQL for structured storage
 of task data, reminders, and logs. • Scheduling: APScheduler for managing timed events and
 periodic checks. • Notifications: Flask-Mail for sending email alerts and Socket.IO for real-time
 dashboard notifications. • Version Control: Git and GitHub for project management and
 collaboration.
Implementation Details
 The implementation began with designing the database schema, including tables for users, tasks,
 and reminders. Each task entry includes attributes such as Task ID, Title, Description, Assigned
 User, Deadline, Reminder Time, and Status. The Flask application defines routes for task creation,
 editing, and listing, along with APIs for fetching reminders. APScheduler runs as a background
 process that scans for tasks nearing their deadlines. When a match is found, it triggers a reminder
 function that: • Sends an email notification using Flask-Mail. • Emits a live notification through
 Socket.IO. • Updates the reminder log in PostgreSQL. The front-end dashboard displays reminders
 in a dedicated “Upcoming Deadlines” section, with color-coded priorities (e.g., red for overdue,
 yellow for today, green for upcoming). This helps users visually identify urgent tasks and manage
 their schedule effectively.

 Testing and Results
 The system was thoroughly tested to ensure accuracy and reliability. Unit testing was performed on
 backend routes and scheduling functions to confirm that reminders triggered correctly. Integration
 testing verified that email notifications and dashboard alerts were delivered simultaneously without
 delay. Performance testing confirmed that the scheduler could handle multiple reminders efficiently.
 All functional and non-functional requirements were met successfully. Results: • 100% of test
 cases for task reminders passed successfully. • Average delay between scheduled time and alert
 delivery: less than 2 seconds. • No data loss observed during concurrent operations. • Improved
 user engagement and timely task completion rates.
 Conclusion and Future Scope
 
 The Task Deadlines and Reminders system efficiently automates deadline tracking and ensures
 users are always aware of their responsibilities. By combining database-driven task storage,
 real-time notifications, and scheduled alerts, it significantly enhances productivity and organization.
 Future Scope: • Integration with Google Calendar and Outlook for seamless synchronization. •
 Mobile app version with push notifications. • AI-based priority prediction to identify critical tasks
 automatically. • Analytics dashboard to track completion rates and user performance over time. This
 project serves as a scalable and practical solution for modern-day task management, ensuring no
 deadline is ever missed again
